# Pure Functions

> In functional programming, the concept of a pure function is one that holds the following two
properties:
* The function should always return the same output for the same input
* The function should not create any side effects.

The first property means that the function's behavior is entirely determined by its input parameters. A simple example is `abs`. The absolute value of an integer is always the same for the same input.

The second property is that a function should not cause any observable changes outside the
function.  It doesn't change the values of variables, doesn't modify external data structures, and doesn't perform any observable actions beyond computing the result.

* No Mutability:

    Pure functions don't modify the data they receive as input. They don't rely on or modify mutable data structures. Instead, they create and return new data structures based on the input.

* No I/O Operations:

    Pure functions don't perform I/O operations, such as reading from or writing to files, databases, or the network. I/O operations are inherently impure because they introduce non-deterministic behavior and side effects.

> If a function is said to be pure, then the function can be replaced at the call site with the result of
the expression.

The advantages of pure functions are several. They are easier to understand, debug or test because their behavior is solely determined by their inputs, and they don't have hidden dependencies or side effects.
