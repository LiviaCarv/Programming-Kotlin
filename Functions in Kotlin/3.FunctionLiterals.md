# Function literals

In Kotlin, function literals allow you to create concise and expressive code by defining functions without explicitly naming them. Function literals are useful when you need to pass a function as an argument to another function, or when you want to define a short, one-time-use function.

To define this type of functions, we simply enclose the code in braces. Function literals can be assigned to a variable just like other literals:

```
val printHello = { println("hello") }
printHello()
```

Function literals can also accept parameters. For this, we write the parameters, along with types,
before a thin arrow; this denotes the function body:

```
val printMessage = {message: String -> println(message)}

```

The use of function literals is primary as **higher order functions**.
