# Higher Order Functions

> A higher order function is simply a function that either accepts another function as a parameter,
returns a function as its return value, or both.

```
fun calc(numberA: Int, numberB: Int, operation: (Int,Int) -> Int) {
    var result = operation(numberA, numberB)
    println("Result: $result")
}
