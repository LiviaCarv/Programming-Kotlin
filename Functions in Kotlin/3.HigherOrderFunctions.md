# Higher Order Functions

> A higher order function is simply a function that either accepts another function as a parameter,
returns a function as its return value, or both.

```
fun calculator(numberA: Int, numberB: Int, operation: (Int,Int) -> Int) {
    var result = operation(numberA, numberB)
    println("Result: $result")
}
```

Here, we have defined a function f`calculator` with three parameters: `numberA` and `numberB` are the two integers that will be operated on and `operation` is a higher-order function parameter that takes two integers (Int, Int) as parameters and returns an integer (Int).

This `calc` function allows you to perform different operations by passing a specific function to it. 

```
calculator(4, 6, {a, b -> 2 * a * b})
```

Also, the `filter` function is an excellent example of a higher-order function. It is commonly used with collections and allows you to selectively include or exclude elements from the collection based on a given predicate.

Take a look at the signature of the filter function in Kotlin's standard library:

```
public inline fun <T> Iterable<T>.filter(predicate: (T) -> Boolean): List<T> {
    // code
}
```

It takes a predicate function that returns a boolean as a parameter, which is used to filter elements, and it returns a `List<T>` containing the elements that meet the specified condition.
