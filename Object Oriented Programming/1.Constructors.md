# Constructors

> A class in Kotlin has a primary constructor and possibly one or more secondary constructors. 

## Primary constructors

1. The primary constructor is declared in the class header, and it goes
after the class name and optional type parameters:

```
class User (var name : String, var isAdmin : Boolean) { }
```

In the example above the keyword **constructor** can be omitted because the primary constructor doesn't have any visilibility modifiers or annotations.
>> properties declared in the primary constructor can be mutable (var) or read-only (val).

---
2. It's also possible to include default values: 
```
class User (
    var name: String = "unknown", 
    var isAdmin: Boolean = true
    ) { }
```
---

## Secondary Constructors

> If the class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to delegate to the primary constructor, either directly (keyword **this**) or indirectly through another
secondary constructor(s).

```
class User (var name : String, var isAdmin : Boolean){
  
    constructor(name: String) : this(name,false) {
        // action
    }

    constructor() : this("unknown",false) {
        // action
    }
}
```

Notice that the third constructor is equivalent to stablish default values in the primary constructor
