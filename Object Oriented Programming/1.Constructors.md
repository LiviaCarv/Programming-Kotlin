# Constructors

> A class in Kotlin has a primary constructor and possibly one or more secondary constructors. 


1. The primary constructor is declared in the class header, and it goes
after the class name and optional type parameters:

```
class User (var name : String, var isAdmin : Boolean) { }
```

In the example above the keyword **constructor** can be omitted because the primary constructor doesn't have any visilibility modifiers or annotations.
>> properties declared in the primary constructor can be mutable (var) or read-only (val).

2. It's also possible to include default values: 
```
class User (
    var name: String = "unknown", 
    var isAdmin: Boolean = true
    ) { }
```
