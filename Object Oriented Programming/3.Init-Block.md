# Init Block

The init block will execute immediately after the primary constructor. Initializer blocks effectively become part of the primary constructor.

From Kotlin Documentation:
> The primary constructor initializes a class instance and its properties in the class header. The class header can't contain any runnable code. If you want to run some
code during object creation, use initializer blocks inside the class body. Initializer blocks are declared with the init keyword followed by curly braces.

Example:
```
class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, val age: Int?) {
    init {
        require(firstName.trim().length > 0) {"Invalid first name."}
        if (age != null) {
            require(age >= 0 && age < 100) {"Invalid age."}
        }
    }
}
```

In the example the validation code will run as part of the  primary constructor. The **require** method will
throw **IllegalArgumentException** with the message you have provided if the expression
given evaluates to False.
