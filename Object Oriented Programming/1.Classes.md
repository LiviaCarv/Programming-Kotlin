# Classes

> Classes are the main building blocks of any object-oriented programming language. A class enables you to create your own type by grouping together methods and variable of other types.  
> > Compared to Java, you can define multiple classes within the same source file.

The class
keyword can be preceded by the access level. If it is not specified, it will default to public; this
means anyone can create objects of this class. The name of the class follows the keyword and the
curly braces contain the class body where the behavior and data are defined: fields, properties,
and methods

```
private class Customer (val id: Int, var email: String = "example@gmail.com") {
    var category: String = ""

    fun checkIn() {
        /*...*/ 
    }
 }
```

## Nested and Inner Classes

### Nested Classes:

Definition: A nested class is a class that is defined within another class.

Scope: It does not have access to the members (properties and methods) of the outer class.

Instance Creation: Instances of a nested class can be created without an instance of the outer class.

```
class Team(val name: String) {
    // Nested class
    class Player(val playerName: String) {
        // Player class members
    }
}
```

```
val teamInstance = Team("Kotlin Team")
val playerInstance = Team.Player("Alice")
```

### Inner Classes:

Definition: An inner class is a class that is defined within another class and marked with the `inner` keyword.

Scope: It has access to the members of the outer class, allowing it to reference the outer class's properties and methods.

Instance Creation: Instances of an inner class can only be created within an instance of the outer class.

```
class School(val name: String) {
    // Outer class property
    val schoolCode = "S123"

    // Inner class marked with 'inner' keyword
    inner class Student(val studentName: String) {
        // Inner class members can access outer class members
        fun displayStudentInfo() {
            println("Student: $studentName, School Code: $schoolCode")
        }
    }
}

// Creating instances of the outer and inner classes
val schoolInstance = School("Kotlin High School")
val studentInstance = schoolInstance.Student("Bob")

// Accessing outer class property from inner class
studentInstance.displayStudentInfo()

```

---
### Nested classes are independent of the instances of the outer class, while inner classes are tied to a specific instance of the outer class and can access its members.

## Enum Classs

> Enumeration is a specific type of class; a variable of a given enum type is limited to a set of
predefined constants: the ones that have been defined by the type. To define an enumeration, you
could use the `enum class` keywords

```
enum class CreditCard {
    VISA,
    MASTER,
    ELO,
    AMEX
}
```
 **Each enum constant is an object. Enum constants are separated by commas.**


Similar to Java, Kotlin provides you with helper methods to work with enumeration classes. 

```
val creditCard: CreditCard = CreditCard.valueOf("VISA")
    for (card in CreditCard.values()) {
        println(card)
    }
```


Enumeration, like all classes, can take a constructor parameter:

```
enum class CreditCard(var label: String, var discount: Int) {
    VISA("Visa", 3),
    MASTER("Mastercard", 2),
    ELO("Elo", 2),
    AMEX("AmericanExpress",1)
}

fun main() {
    for (card in CreditCard.values()) {
        println("${card.label} card gives a ${card.discount}% discount!")
    }

}
```
