# Visibility Modifiers

> There are four visibility modifiers in Kotlin: private, protected, internal, and public. The default visibility is public.
>
1. **Public**: This can be accessed from anywhere
2. **Internal**: This can only be accessed from the _module_ code
3. **Protected**: This can only be accessed from the class defining it and any derived classes
4. **Private**: This can only be accessed from the scope of the class defining it
