# Abstract Classes

> Adding the `abstract` keyword in front of the class definition will mark the class as abstract: An abstract class is a partially defined class; properties and methods that have no implementation
must be implemented in a derived class, unless the derived class is meant to be an abstract
class as well.

1. An abstract class is characterized by the presence of at least one abstract method. An abstract method is declared without a body, and its implementation is deferred to the concrete subclasses.
   
2.  You cannot create an instance of an abstract class. The role of such a class is to provide a
common set of methods that multiple derived classes share.

3.  Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, as well as properties with or without initial values.
Concrete methods in an abstract class may have an implementation.

Example: 

```
abstract class AbstractShape(var name:String, var color: String) {

    abstract fun calculateArea() : Double

    fun description() {
        println("This is a $name shape that has an area of: ${calculateArea()} square centimeters.")
    }
}

class Circle(var radius: Double, color: String): AbstractShape("circular", color) {
    override fun calculateArea(): Double {
        return PI * radius.pow(2)
    }
}

class Rectangle(var length: Double, var width: Double, color: String): AbstractShape("rectangular", color) {
    override fun calculateArea(): Double {
        return length * width
    }
}
```

Notice that both the `Circle` and `Rectangle` subclasses inherit the concrete method `description()` from the `AbstractShape` class but have to provide their own implementation of the abstract method `calculateArea()`, wich has a specific behavior unique to each shape.
