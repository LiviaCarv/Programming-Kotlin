# Basic types

> One of the big changes in Kotlin from Java is that in Kotlin everything is an object: 
>>in Java there are special primitive
types which are treated differently from objects. They cannot be used as generic types, do not support method/function calls, and cannot be assigned null. Java introduced wrapper objects to offer a work around in which primitive types are wrapped in objects.
>>> **Kotlin removes this necessity entirely from the language by promoting the primitives to full
objects.**

## Numbers
### Integer types

* When you initialize a variable with no explicit type specification, the compiler automatically infers the type with the smallest range enough to represent the value
starting from Int.
* To specify the Long value explicitly, append the suffix L to the
value. 

### Floating-point types

* To explicitly specify the Float type for a value, add the suffix f or F. 

## Strings

* Strings are immutable. Once you initialize a string, you can't change its value or assign a new value to it. All operations that transform strings return their results in a
new String object, leaving the original string unchanged

* Double quotes create an **escaped string**: wich can contain escaped characters. Escaping is done in the conventional way, with a backslash (\\)
  ```
  var message = "Ola\nTudo bom?" 
  ```
* **Multiline string**s: t is delimited by a triple quote ("""), contains no escaping and can contain newlines and any other
characters.
    ```
    var multiline = """
            Ola 
            Seu produto ja chegou
        """.trimIndent()
    ```

* String literals may contain template expressions: pieces of code that are evaluated and whose results are concatenated into the string. A template expression
starts with a dollar sign ($) and consists of either a name or an expression.

    ```
    val message = "Ol√° $nome, voce tem" +
            " $idade anos e seu produto chegou!"
    ```

## Characters

Chars represent a single character. Character literals use single quote and support support escaping for the following characters: \t, \b, \n, \r, ', ", and \$.
