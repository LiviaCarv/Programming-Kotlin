# Type checks and casts

If a reference to an instance is declared as some general type A, but we want to test if we have a more specific type B, then Kotlin provides the `is` operator. This is equivalent to the `instanceof` operator in Java.

```
if (obj is String) {
    print(obj.length)
} 

// or

if (obj !is String) { // Same as !(obj is String)
    print("Not a String")
}
```

# Smart casts

When a type check is performed using `is`, the compiler automatically casts the variable to the checked type within the corresponding block, allowing you to use it as such without an explicit cast.

```
val anyValue: Any = "Hello"

if (anyValue is String) {
    // Automatically cast to String within this block
    println("Length of string: ${anyValue.length}")
}
```

Smart casts work for when expressions and while loops as well:
```
when (x) {
    is Int -> print(x + 1)
    is String -> print(x.length + 1)
    is IntArray -> print(x.sum())
}
```

> **Note that smart casts work only when the compiler can guarantee that the variable won't change between the check and its usage.**

## Explicit casting

To cast a reference to a type explicitly, we use the `as` operator. Just as in Java, this operation will throw a ClassCastException if the cast cannot be performed legally:

```
val x: String = y as String
```

If we want to avoid possible exceptions, and instead have a null value if the cast fails, then we can use the safe cast operator `as?`. This operator will return the casted value if the target type is compatible, otherwise it will return null.
```
val x: String? = y as? String
```
