# Local Functions 

>  Kotlin allows us to take this a step further by supporting functions declared inside other functions.
These are called local or nested functions. Functions can even be nested multiple times.

```
fun printHypotenuse(sideA: Double, sideB: Double) {
    fun calculateHyp() : Double = sqrt( sideA.pow(2) + sideB.pow(2))
    val hypotenuse = calculateHyp()
    println("The hypotenuse is equal to $hypotenuse")
}
```

As you can see, the `calculateHyp` function is now inside `printHypotenuse` and thus not accessible to
the code outside. This is useful when we want to hide functions that are just used as
implementation details of a larger function. 

* Notice that Local functions can access the parameters and variables defined in the outer scope. This makes the nested function more readable
and saves repeating the parameter definitions.

Let's thake the well-known Fizz Buzz problem. Notice in the example below that we can define local functions not just directly inside other functions, but
also in for loops, while loops, and other blocks.


```
fun fizzbuzz(start: Int, end: Int) {
    for (number in start..end) {
        fun isFizz() : Boolean = number % 3 == 0
        fun isBuzz() : Boolean = number % 5 == 0

        when {
            isFizz() && isBuzz() -> println("Fizz Buzz")
            isFizz() -> println("Fizz")
            isBuzz() -> println("Buzz")
            else -> println(number)
        }
    }
}
```
